# Door-Lock-Security-System-ATmega32
The Door Lock Security System project aims to create a robust and secure mechanism for unlocking a door using a password. The project leverages two ATmega32 Microcontrollers, each operating at 8MHz, and is designed based on a layered architecture model for efficient and modular functionality.
